[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/) supports the
[Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) templating engine. Today I'm going to update
the way my blog renders by rendering in a continuous style much like how Dave
Winer's [Scripting.com](https://www.scripting.com) site works. I like the
layout, and I'm hoping to build something out that looks more like this.
