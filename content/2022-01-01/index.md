I miss Euan Garden. 

![Euan Garden](2022-01-01-09-37-04.png)

Euan was a friend, a colleague, and a former boss. He's one of the first
people who pop into my mind when I think of the phrase "a man of character". I
can remember so many stories from our many conversations over the years,
starting with the first time that I met him when he was interviewing to become
my boss in the Technical Computing Group at Microsoft over a decade ago. It
was a normal interview until the end when he started fanboying over some work
that I had done earlier with Delphi and COM. I think that anyone who has met
Euan before could imagine the AMOUNT OF ENTHUSIASM with which said fanboying
was done. But he did it not in a way that would make him seem like he was
angling for the job (despite the circumstances) but in the true spirit of love
for the technology. During that time when Euan was my boss on that amazing
team so long ago he was a great boss, one that would at the same time give me
room to explore crazy ideas and the wisdom to step in when my crazy ideas
would go out of control :)

At some point, it became clear to all of us that Technical Computing was not
going to be a thing at Microsoft. When I was recruited into the Windows team
(hi, Mahesh!) coincidentally to own COM and to build the new WinRT programming
model on top of it, I had to break the news to Euan over the holidays. I
needed to do it in person, so I remember driving over to his old house (he
wound up moving across the street to his new house believe it or not) to break
the news. As you might expect, Euan was gracious and helpful during the
transition as that was going to become my first experience with being a
manager at Microsoft.

We were never too far away from each other over the years. I remember random
conversations with him that included:

- How to talk to the police if you happen to have shot an intruder in your
  house
- Why driving to work in a scooter while wearing shorts was the only way to
  travel in December in Redmond
- Why having an Xbox in every room in your house as a media extender was the
  only way to live
- Why Thinkpads are the ONE TRUE LAPTOP

We re-united on the same (larger) team when I joined the Python team after my
stint in Windows. It was great having him just upstairs from me where I could
drop in to get his sage advice on many things as I sought to be helpful to my
new team. His work then was deeply influential on some things that I'm working
on now. When we ship, it's going to be in no small part due to our many chats
over the years. I'm proud to be able to carry forward his work and I'll
continue to think of him often as we continue on his journey.

Godspeed, Euan.

## More on the metaverse

So I was procrastinating today after discovering Tim Urban on Twitter (how is 
it possible that I did not know he existed?):

{{ twitter(id="1476962460049584136")}}

I went down the rabbit hole and discovered his TED Talk:

{{ youtube(id="arj7oStGLkU")}}

And his incredibly [funny
writeup](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html)
of what it was like to write his TED Talk.

I was watching it on my phone while sitting on my couch next to my dog who
loves to sleep on my couch. Which got me thinking about what this experience
would be like if I were watching this in VR. It struck me then, in the middle
of watching a talk on procrastination, that at limits of technology, **it
wouldn't look any different at all**.

That's a problem. It also got me thinking about how early movies looked no
different than watching a play at a theater ... they haven't invented editing
yet! So they simply recorded what it was like to watch a play, which made it
possible for people who were not in the room at the time that the play was
showing to experience the play, albeit in a somewhat degraded experience.

My experience in Horizon Meeting Rooms yesterday was one where it feels like
those early movies - we are literally putting people into a 3D room to
experience what it would be like to be in the same place physically. That to
me feels like those early movies - we made it possible for people to
experience a play without being in the same space physically. But why should
we be constrained by the limitations of reality? What is the equivalent of 
editing in the metaverse? I don't have any answers here, but at least I have
figured out a question and that's a start.

(An aside) I viscerally remember this thought popping into my head while I was
watching Tim's talk. I think this is another great example of [Beer
Mode](https://perell.com/note/open-mode-and-closed-mode/) thinking which I
think is extremely important for creative professionals. Random inputs can 
stimulate thinking in different and unexpected ways, especially with ideas 
that are tumbling around in your subconcious. Or at least that's how I'm
justifying procrastination.

## Spatial context and VR

Here's a sequence of photos that I took today at the Microsoft Library:

They represent zooming in on a piece of information. I find that my memory
works this way - I can remember where something is located spatially, often
times even in cases where I cannot remember the information itself.

Today, VR-based solutions like [Horizon
Workrooms](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/)
create meeting spaces that mimic existing meeting rooms. Since I haven't yet
had meetings inside of a Workroom yet, I can't comment on the experience
first-hand. But watching some YouTube videos it seems like they're striving to
create an experience that mimics a real-world meeting room, which is great
start and requires a tremendous amount of engineering effort to get right.

But let's imagine that we're not limited by what we can do in a physical
meeting room. What if we could take advantage of our spatial memory and leave
objects around the room? What if those objects could be zoomed into
"infinitely" to reveal more about what they represent? What if we could
version control the state of the objects in the room? 

One of the great things about being messy, like these famous desks is that
they respresent __saved context__ in a physical space. I would like to imagine
that those piles represent trains of thought and can help bring them back into
the context (or at least remind them of the context!)

Modern information is mainly accessed in one of two ways: by search or through
storing files in a file system. The problem with both of these approaches is
that neither of them take advantage of our natural spatial awareness or our
ability to organize information into hierarchies (you're already good at this
- you can probably tell me exactly where in your house your toothbrush, your
keys, or the milk is located). 

What's worse is that they also remove any cues you may have that the
information exists at all. What would be great is if we could have a system
where you could arrange the information spatially, and that spatial
information could be version controlled. This way the context is maintained.

Shared meeting room spaces are reset for each meeting. However, what if we can
always recreate (or even version control) different meeting contexts? If I met
with you last week, when we re-enter the meeting room everything is exactly
where we left it from our last visit. This way we can take advantage of our
spatial memory to organize information in a virtual space instead of relying
on search or other cumbersome window-based ways of retrieving information. We
could also integrate this with search "find my car keys in the house", which
would reveal the item and its location.

This way we can transcend what is possible spatially and not create a world
that is merely a lower-fidelity imitation of the real world. I get that the
primary benefit that early adopters get from Workrooms is going to be allowing
people that are distant to collaborate in a more meaninful way, much like
those early films allowed people not in the room to experience the play.
That's already super-valuable, especially in today's world. But perhaps
spatial context could be akin to editing in films and create an entirely new
medium in which we can collaborate?
