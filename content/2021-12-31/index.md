I went to Best Buy this afternoon and bought an Oculus Quest 2 because I
wanted to spend some time this holiday seeing how real [Ben
Thompson's](https://stratechery.com/2021/enterprise-metaverses-horizon-workrooms-workrooms-facebook-problem/)
take on the Metaverse was. I'm pretty amazed at what they were able to cram
into a $299 device. To quote:

I'm writing this back on my PC after spending about 30 minutes in a Horizon
Workroom by myself. So here's a really quick take on what I liked and didn't
like about the experience:

The immersive feeling is real. I really like how, with Horizon Remote
desktop installed on my PC, I could interact with and type on my PC.

The experience with the whiteboard was ... interesting. I get that this is
using $299 worth of consumer-level hardware, so I'm not expecting a whole lot.
You can write on the whiteboard using one of the controllers flipped around so
that you're using the bottom like a pen. This was ... OK, but clearly not as
good as it could be with better hardware. However I am holding my arm out in
space vs. bracing it against a real whiteboard so I'm not sure how better 
hardware can help in this regard.

The latency while using my keyboard and mouse was pretty jarring. Now I
totally respect that I can actually do things with this, but this is very
early adopter territory. Oculus Remote Desktop is pretty confused with
multi-monitor setups though (Aero snap on Windows doesn't do what I would
expect), and I need to take off my headset and manually move windows to my
primary monitor to get it to work correctly. It is usable though. I wonder if
it's any better with USB tethering to my PC?

The resolution is limiting. I get that this will get better over time but it
likely needs to be a LOT better. I'm looking at two 27" 4K monitors right now
and that's my ideal experience. I would imagine 25MP per eye will get us
pretty close to the experience I have already, but that's 7x more pixels than
I'm seeing right now at 1832x1920 per eye, which is still quite amazing
considering it's a $299 device!

Even though I wouldn't call the Quest heavy, it does have a noticeable heft
on my head. I wonder how well this will hold out during a meeting (I have
one scheduled for later this week with a friend to see how well this works).

I'd really like the device to do a better job tracking where my hands are and
letting me see them as I type on my keyboard. I hit keys like F10/F11 all the
time and I can't really touch type those keys as it's quite a reach from the
home position (try it yourself to see what I mean). I'd also like to see my
mouse as well - I would imagine that this will get much better in the future.

But back to the latency - this is probably the biggest technical issue that I
see with the hardware right now. But there's promise here. It feels very
Christensen disruptive (if the collaborative room experience is as good as Ben
claims). 

I'll try it again later tonight. But this does feel like the future. But we're
definitely not there right now.
