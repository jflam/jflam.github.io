Today was talk day in Las Vegas. I will have a lot more details to write about
the talk later, but giving this (non-recorded) talk was a super-fun experience
both for me, and my co-presenter [Alon
Bochman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alonbochman/). We had a great
conversation afterwards, and among the many things we talked about was the
importance of Beer Mode to me. I was reminiscing about the early days of the
Ruby community that I was so fortunate to have been a part of and how the
serendipitous conversations I had at those early RubyConfs forever changed my
life.

Speaking of serendipity, Hacker News is one of my best sources for random Beer
Mode input. I saw [Rockstar: a language for programs that are also hair metal
power ballads](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29476545) tonight on HN
and in the comments (unlike YouTube, *always* read the comments on HN), I
discovered this incredible talk by [Dylan Beattie](https://dylanbeattie.net/)
the guy who spec'd, implemented and performed a program written in Rockstar.

This instantly became one of my favorite talks of all time. It looks at
programming as an art form - especially given that all his examples which
range from Conway's Game of Life through to the mathematics behind Mendelbrot
plots, the esoteric world of programming _quines_ (programs that print
themselves as output) and _polyquines_ which are beyond incredible, and
finally his performance of a program written in Rockstar.

Watching this reminded me of [Giles Bowkett's](https://gilesbowkett.com/)
incredible Archaeopteryx talk that I was fortunate enough to have watched live
at RubyConf Salt Lake City almost a decade ago. He was featured recently in
another book that I love called [So Good They Can't Ignore
You](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/) by Cal Newport. This is 
a masterful talk that was also a piece of performance art.

This sent me down memory lane thinking about incredible talks that I have 
seen in the past. This talk by Guy Steele Jr. was and remains at the top
of my list of most incredible performance art talks that I have seen. This
also relates somewhat to Ruby as I attended my one and only OOSPLA in 2005
just before I attended my first RubyConf in 2005 as part of a "learning 
vacation" that I took back then. So good - it starts off super weird but 
I promise you it's worth sticking through to the end.
