## Joe Rogan, Robert Malone and the history of mRNA vaccines

The current controversy-de-jour is Joe Rogan's interviews with vaccine
skeptics. Today, Joe posted an Instagram post where he highlights his
controversial interviews with [Peter
McCullough](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LzqEaOkAAAAJ) and
[Robert Malone](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Jf1bApYAAAAJ).

It's worth listening to.

At first I had no idea who Robert Malone was, so tonight I went looking.
It's highly likely that mRNA vaccines will recognized in this year's Nobel
Prize awards. As background in the runup to the awards, this [article in
Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02483-w) does a great job
of outlining the history of the development of mRNA vaccines. In this article
I learned more about the development of mRNA vaccines and Robert Malone's 
role in it.

Apparently he was one of the first people to [observe protein
transcription](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/86/16/6077.full.pdf)
following _in vitro_ insertion of mRNA encapsulated inside of liposomes.
Here's an excerpt of his graduate student lab notebook from the day of that
observation:

Many other scientists are highlighted, including [Katalin
Karikó](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PS_CX0AAAAAJ&hl=en), who
pioneered [modifying mRNA using
pseudouridine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761305002116)
to suppress immunological response towards it. [Pieter
Cullis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ANV63uwAAAAJ&hl=en) who made
key contributions towards developing [lipid
nanoparticles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-021-00358-0) that are an
essential piece of technology that enables safe delivery of mRNA into human
cells. 

This diagram from the Nature review paper on lipid nanoparticles shows the
parallel development of mRNA and lipid nanoparticle technology that resulted
in the creation of the vaccines that we enjoy today, and the times when
pseudouridine and lipid nanoparticles (and many other discoveries) entered the
picture:

So what does all of this have to do with Joe Rogan again? He was accused of
bringing contervailing opinions onto his show and giving them a platform.
However, it's worth remembering that scientific progress does not progress in
the idealized straight line seen in the diagram above. There are many twists
and turns, and occasional reversals of course. Sometimes what was accepted as
dogma at one point in the past winds up being known to be false today.

There's a story that [Ingmar
Hoerr](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ingmar-Hoerr) tells about the time
when he presented his [early mouse data on direct injection of
mRNA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1521-4141(200001)30:1%3C1::AID-IMMU1%3E3.0.CO;2-%23):

> there was a Nobel prizewinner standing up in the first row saying, ‘This is
> completely shit what you’re telling us here — completely shit’.

In fact, this entire field was woefully underfunded precisely because it was
outside mainstream science in the 2000s. _What if funding for this field never 
happened?_ 

The solution to people saying things that are contrary to the mainstream
belief is not to censor them. Rather, we should combat that by, as [Ben
Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-liberty/) says, using _more
free speech_. There's a lovely quote from Ben's article that I'm reproducing
below that cites John Stuart Mill's [On
Liberty](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm) (from
1859):

Joe admits as much in his Instagram post. He says he will try to ensure that
other opinions are presented on his show in close proximity to the
"controversial opinions". And even if he doesn't, Joe Rogan is hardly the only
platform on the Internet.
