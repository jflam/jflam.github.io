Continued to listen to Tim's interview with [Andrew
Chen](https://andrewchen.com/) today and learned about his new book. In the
interview he talks about how he uses Twitter as a way to source writing ideas.
Tim called it "his MVP for writing" which makes a ton of sense. I also learned
that Andrew is writing a new book called the [Cold Start
Problem](https://www.amazon.com/The-Cold-Start-Problem/dp/B08MKNHSWC/) (which
of course is why he's on Tim's podcast). It also explains why he started the
podcast with a great story about how coupons solved the cold start problem
from over 100 years ago!

I love how he's building viral promotional campaign for his book. 

Step 1: canvas your audience to engage them on the content:

Step 2: publish excerpts on different types of social media to non-overlapping
audiences:

{{ twitter(id="1465921554152181762")}}

Step 3: profit!
