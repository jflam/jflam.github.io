That was a F1 championship for the ages; certainly the best one that I can
remember since I started watching a decade ago during the Vettel era. A bit
of luck certainly contributed to Max's win, but can we talk about just how
well the Red Bull team managed Max during the race? The call to pit for new
hard tires under the virtual safety car and the call to pit for new soft tires
under the safety car were clearly the calls that made the difference in a race
where it was clear that Lewis had the faster car. 

Mercedes really need to look in the mirror here as what they needed to do was
cover off any pit stops that Max did. They will of course appeal to the FIA,
but I can't imagine them changing the title in the courts.

Something else to talk about: Sergio Perez. In the era of selfish F1 teammates
his sacrifice and ultimate retirement this weekend clearly enabled Max to get
not only pole position but possibly the race itself. His epic battle with
Lewis made up a huge gap that let Max back into contention in the race.

Regardless of what happens in the end, this was an epic end to an amazing 
season. Both Lews and Max deserved to win this race. Lewis behaved like the 
GOAT that he is and was so gracious in congratulating Max, gutting as it must 
have been for him. It was also great to see, in the back of the paddock, this
scene with Anthony Hamilton and Jos Verstappen congratulating Max on his win.

Also these scenes with the fathers consoling and congratulating their sons:

These are the human moments in sport, and I'm grateful to have been here to
see this.
