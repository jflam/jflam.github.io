Beer mode is extremely important to me: it's how I discover new ideas
serendipitously. Twitter is a great place for beer mode activities, but it's
also a toxic cesspool full of shitposting and virtue signaling. It's
entertaining, exhausting, and distracting.

Fortunately, there are a small number of users who consistently post great
content focused on an area that I'm interested in. They are, essentially, 
"professional tweeters". Or, if you prefer terms from a bygone era, they are
_micro-bloggers_. 

You can configure tweetdeck, which is the only Twitter client you should 
use, as it lets you configure exactly how you want to view tweets and you 
can remove the algorithmic timeline (and ads) from it entirely. At first, I
configured tweetdeck to follow individual users which worked great and cut
down the noise considerably. 

But I still saw _replies_ from those users. While that isn't necessarily a bad
thing, it's really random when you see it in a column as the context isn't
really there. I really prefer starting from the top of a thread and then
seeing any replies that they may be making to other users on their thread. 
The trick that I learned to do this is to create search columns instead of 
user columsn. You just need to use this format for the advanced search 
syntax:

`from:user_name -filter:replies`

That's it! Here's a screenshot of how this looks in tweetdeck
