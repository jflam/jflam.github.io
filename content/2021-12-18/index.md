{% block() %} Tim O'Reilly, one of our elder statesmen of the web, has written
a great [analysis article on
Web3](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-its-too-early-to-get-excited-about-web3/).
It is well worth reading the post in its entirety, as he does a really good
job at constructing arguments without being confrontational in his reasoning.
he does this by asking questions without presuming what the answers are. This
is probably the most balanced account of Web3 that I've read so far and well
worth your time. {% end %}

I've been thinking a lot about the parallels between liquid chromatography and
espresso making. I found this [article that delves into both the chemistry and
physics of espresso
brewing](https://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/694285/Espresso__A_Three-Step_Preparation.html).
