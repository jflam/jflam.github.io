There's long been an argument by crypto enthusiasts that we need crypto to
fight against the dastardly fees charged by Western Union and the like in the
3rd world. In this post by Patrick McKenzie (aka patio11) [More than you want
to know about gift
cards](https://bam.kalzumeus.com/archive/more-than-you-want-to-know-about-gift-cards/)
it seems like there's a strong argument to be made for using gift cards to 
work around the fees charged by Western Union?

This morning on HN I found this course on [Natural Language Processing for
Semantic Search](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/nlp/) by a startup called
pinecone. This is my current area of interest, which is why I created a 
simple [wine semantic search engine](https://github.com/jflam/wine) a while
ago to explore this area. Taking a look at a couple of chapters it definitely
looks interesting and worth a longer look over the holidays.

There's another post by someone who is trying to build a [news
site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29551686) that is kind of like the
original Yahoo aggregator, but with the twist of having _sagas_ which let you
follow a story as it progresses, e.g., salacious news like the Theranos trial
which unfolds over a long period of time. It looks like it is curated by the
poster though. I would love to combine the idea of sagas with some kind of AI
filter that is trained on my interests to pull tweets and news articles into a
personal feed for my own consumption. This way it is aligned with my interests
vs. the interests of the aggregator.
