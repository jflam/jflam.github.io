I'm getting ready to fly to Las Vegas for my first talk in ages: [Train a
Kaggle Winner Under $50 on
Azure](https://www.azureaiconf.com/#!/session/Train%20a%20Kaggle%20winner%20for%20under%20$50%20on%20Azure/4934).
One thing that I'm planning to share with my audience is this amazing Derek
Sivers TED Talk on how to start a movement; it could just as easily be how to
start an Open Source project as well!

At my talk, I'm going to be releasing a project that I've been working on for
a while: [ez](https://github.com/jflam/ez) that hopefully makes using Azure as
a powerful _personal computer_ much easier than it is today.
