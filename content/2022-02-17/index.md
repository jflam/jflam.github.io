I'm traveling and just got some time to myself to write down a bunch of stuff
that I've learned listening to podcasts during over 1000 miles driving in a
car.

## Types of Procrastination

From the wisdom of Tim Urban:

- Type 1 procrastination is what you do when there is a deadline present. The
[panic
monster](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html)
will eventually awaken as when the deadline is imminent which will chase away
the instant gratification monkey.

- Type 2 procrastination is what you do when there *isn't a deadline present*. 
This type of procrastination is really, really bad because the panic monster
will never awaken to snap you back to your senses. There really isn't a good
solution to this kind of procrastination.

## Types of Fun

From the wisdom of Kate Courtney:

- Type 1 fun is fun while you are doing it.
- Type 2 fun is fun when you are finished doing it.
- Type 3 fun is never fun

## Tim Urban and long form writing

The [Tim Ferris interview with Tim
Urban](https://tim.blog/2018/02/03/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-tim-urban/)
reveals a bit about how Tim (Urban) learns things. His long-form posts are him
teaching himself what he's learned about a topic in hopes that it will help
past Tim learn that topic more effectively. He really is just writing for
himself:

> Yeah. So, it’s pretty simple for me. First of all, I do this kind of weird
> thing where I assume that my audience is I picture like a stadium full of
> me. So, it’s narcistic fantasy. No, but it’s just – I’m just writing for –
> I’m writing the exact post that I would be thrilled to get.

Some tidbits:

- On a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is a world class expert, he starts at a 2 and
continues learning until he gets to about a 5 or a 6. Then he writes the post.
This sometimes takes him 3 hours, sometimes 3 days, sometimes 3 months(!)

- He starts with general sources of information like Wikipedia on a topic. He
then starts writing down questions (which can be expressed as concepts) and
opens a new browser window for each question. Then he CTRL+clicks the Google
results for each question. Then he sits down to read. He doesn't try to filter
at this point - he just reads and starts forming an impression for each
question.

## Elon Musk is a Nerdy David Goggins

After listening to back-to-back interviews and books during my long drives, it
occurred to me that they are both intense, driven men that have overcome many
obstacles during their lives. Different things for sure, but things that many
would think are impossible. Some of the things that they did look stupid to
outsiders, but I'm convinced that they share the same mindset when it comes
to overcoming obstacles in their lives. 

Here's an interesting example:

- David Goggins ran a 24 hour race and completing 101 miles in ~18 hours with
zero specific race preparation 
- Elon Musk started a rocket company and burned through nearly his entire
PayPal fortune in doing so. A friend even sent him a video compilation of
failed rocket launches to try and convince him to not start SpaceX in the
first place.

While the _impact_ of those things are quite different, I think the _meta
impact_ of those things are quite similar. They both could inspire others to
realize that things are not as impossible as what others think - you are
capable of more than what you are capable of. They will also inspire different
kinds of people as well. I don't think anyone will use SpaceX as motivation to
become a Navy SEAL any more than I think anyone will use Goggins'
accomplishments to create the next SpaceX.

I highly recommend listening to the [Audible version of Can't Hurt
Me](https://amzn.to/3rW6aoV). In it, you'll hear the book as narrated by his
writer, Adam Skolnick. But at key moments in the story, they will cut away to
a "podcast format" where David gives additional commentary and context to the
story at that point in time. It's a really effective format that I wish others
would copy in their audiobooks.
