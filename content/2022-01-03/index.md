The [AsmTutor site](https://asmtutor.com/) is a great introduction to NASM. I
especially like how it begins with making Linux `syscalls`.

## The real sequel to On Intelligence

About 20 years ago, I read Jeff Hawkins' excellent book [On
Intelligence](https://numenta.com/resources/on-intelligence/). One of the
things that really struck me back then was his description of how we could 
map different sensors to the neocortex, effectively creating a cyborg. I had
always thought that this meant a physical fusion of human and machine. But 
then I read this quote and realized ... that we are **already** cyborgs.

> The thing that people, I think, don’t appreciate right now is that they are

> missing limb syndrome. I think people—they’re already kind of merged with
> their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything.

This quote is from the excellent [Neuralink and the Brain's Magical
Future](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) feature from Tim Urban,
which I now regard as the real successor to On Intelligence (don't bother with
Jeff Hawkins sequel - A Thousand Brains). This 38,000 word epic builds a
compelling case for why we need to create a Brain-Machine-Interface, starting
with a very entertaining and interesting introduction to neuroscience. 

There's a very large hand wave in the middle of the article where he
transitions from a discussion of how we got here to where we could go.
Building a BMI is a very hard problem and he does a great job at explaining
through analogy exactly why it is such a hard problem, and also motivating why
we need to tackle this problem. 

While some may look at the article as a lot of Elon fanboyism, I think it does
a great job at capturing what motivates Elon. It took me several hours and a
couple of days to read the entire thing. But it's well worth the investment in
time.
